    ## Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning
    
    This application utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze movement patterns,
    handwriting, gait, and other biomarkers to detect early signs of Parkinson's disease.
    
    **Research Objectives:**
    - Develop non-invasive screening tools for early detection
    - Improve accessibility of Parkinson's screening
    - Assist medical professionals with objective data for diagnosis
    
    **Note:** This application is for screening purposes only and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.

    ### About the Project:
    This project aims to develop a non-invasive, accessible tool for early detection of Parkinson's disease
    using machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques. By analyzing movement patterns,
    handwriting samples, gait, voice, and other biomarkers, we hope to provide a preliminary screening
    method that can alert users to potential signs of Parkinson's disease and encourage them to seek
    professional medical advice.
